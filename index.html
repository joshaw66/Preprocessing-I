      <h3>A Jack of All Tech Trades</h3>
      <p class="maincontent">I am a creative and driven individual who has always
        had an eye for design. I am experience in all levels of cinema production
        including lighting, sound design and most importantly: cinematography.
        I am learning Web Development and so far, I am having a great time doing it.

      <h1 class="whycode">Why Did I Decide to Learn Code?</h1>
      <p>I have always had an interest for development and coding. My
        passion has always been film-making, and I will continue to work in the film
        industry for the remainder of my life. However, there are many skills I wan't
        to learn that can add many feathers to my cap. Having a background in the back-end
        of design, as well as the front, is invaluable. I am very excited to continue
        learning all I can!
